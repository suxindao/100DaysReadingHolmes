Chapter 27

“This gentleman?” she asked, facing round to me.

“No, his friend.

He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now.”

“The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows.

“What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he.

I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.”

“I fully share your opinion, and I also believe that we may prove it,” returned Holmes, knocking the snow from his shoes.

“I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder.

Might I ask you a question or two?”

“Please do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.”

“You heard nothing yourself last night?”

“Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly.

I heard that, and I came down.”

“You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?”

“Yes .”

“Were they all fastened this morning?”

“Yes.”

“You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?”

“Yes, and she was the girl who served us in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet (王冠) .”

“I see.

You mean that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.”

“But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the banker impatiently, “when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet (王冠) in his hands?”

“Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume (猜测) ?”

“Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night, I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the darkness.”

“Do you know him?”

“Oh, yes! He is the shopkeeper who brings us our vegetables.

His name is Francis Prosper.”

“He stood,” said Holmes, “to the left of the door—that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?”

“Yes, he did.”

“And he is a man with a wooden leg?”

Something like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black eyes.

“Why, you are like a magician,” said she.

“How do you know that?” She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’s thin, eager face.

“I would like to go upstairs now,” said he.

“I shall probably want to examine the outside of the house again.

Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.”

He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane.

This he opened and made a very careful examination of the window-sill with his powerful magnifying lens.

“Now we shall go upstairs,” said he at last.

The banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little room, with a gray carpet, a large desk, and a long mirror.

Holmes went to the desk first and looked hard at the lock.

“Which key was used to open it?” he asked.

“That which my son himself mentioned—that of the cupboard of the store-room.”

“Do you have it here?”

“That is it on the dressing-table.”

Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the desk.

“It is a noiseless lock,” said he.

“It is no wonder that it did not wake you.

This case, I presume (猜测) , contains the coronet (王冠) .

We must have a look at it.”

He opened the case and laid the coronet (王冠) upon the table.

It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen.

At one side of the coronet (王冠) was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three jewels had been torn away.

“Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost.

Please try to break it off.”

The banker stepped back in horror.

“I should not dream of trying,” said he.

“Then I will.” Holmes suddenly used his strength upon it, but without result.

“I feel it move a little,” said he, “but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would be very difficult for me to break it.

An ordinary man could not do it.

Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder?

There would be a noise like a pistol shot.

Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?”

“I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.”

“But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go.

What do you think, Miss Holder?”

“I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity (困惑) .”

“Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?”

“He had nothing on except his trousers and shirt.”

“Thank you.

We have certainly been very lucky during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up.

With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside.”

He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult.

For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable (高深莫测的) as ever.

“I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,” said he, “I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.”

“But the jewels, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?”

“I cannot tell.”

The banker wrung (搓着) his hands.

“I shall never see them again!” he cried. “And my son? You give me hopes?”

“My opinion is in no way altered.”

“Then what was this dark business in my house last night?”

“If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms tomorrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer.

I understand that you give me complete freedom to act for you, provided only that I get back the jewels, and that you place no limit on the expense.”

“I would give everything I own to have them back.”

“Very good. I shall look into the matter between now and then.

Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.”
