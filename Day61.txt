Chapter 13
================
“ ‘It is your only chance,’ said she.

‘It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.’

“As she spoke I saw a light at the end of the passage,

and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a large butcher’s knife in the other.

I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out.

How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down.

I climbed out upon the window-sill, but I hesitated to jump until I had heard what passed between the woman and the evil villain (罪犯) who pursued me.

If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance.

The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her;

but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.

“ ‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English, ‘remember your promise after the last time.

You said it should not be again.

He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!’

“ ‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break away from her.

‘You will be the ruin of us.

He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!’

He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon.

I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands from the window-sill, when his blow fell.

I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.


“I was shaken but not hurt by the fall;

so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet.

Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.

I glanced down at my hand, which was hurting badly and then,

for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound.

I tried to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.

“I cannot tell how long I remained unconscious.

It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and the sun was rising, when I awoke.

My clothes were wet with dew (露水) , and my coat-sleeve was soaked with blood from my wounded thumb.

The pain of it recalled in an instant all the details of my night’s adventure,

and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might still be in danger from my pursuers .

But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden was to be seen.

I had been lying under a hedge close to the road, and just a little lower down was a long building,

which proved to be the railway station at which I had arrived upon the previous night.

If it were not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.

“Half dazed (头晕的) , I went into the station and asked about the morning train.

There would be one to Reading in less than an hour.

The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived.

I asked him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Stark.

The name was unknown to him.

Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not.

Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.

“It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was.

I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police.

It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here.

I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.”

We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative (故事) .

Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the large books in which he placed his cuttings.

“Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he.

“It appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this:

“Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic (水力的) engineer.

Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in—

etc., etc. Ha!

That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine repaired, I imagine.”

“Good heavens!” cried my patient.

“Then that explains what the girl said.”

“Undoubtedly.

It is quite clear that the colonel was a fearless and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game,

like those pirates who will leave no survivors from a captured ship.

Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard before starting for Eyford.”

Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.

There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic (水力的) engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, another policeman, and myself.

Bradstreet had spread an map of the county out upon the seat and was busy drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.

“There you are,” said he.

“That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village.

The place we want must be somewhere near that line.

You said ten miles, I think, sir.”

“It was an hour’s good drive.”

“And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?”

“They must have done so.

l have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and carried somewhere.”

“What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden.

Perhaps the villain (罪犯) was softened by the woman’s pleas.”

“I hardly think that likely.

I never saw a more pitiless face in my life.”

“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Bradstreet.

“Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found.”

“I think I could lay my finger on it,” said Holmes quietly.
